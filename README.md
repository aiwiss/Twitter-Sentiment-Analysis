<h1>Twitter Sentiment Analysis Application For Predicting The Public Opinion Trends Regarding "Brexit"</h1>

<p>
This is a study project. By doing this project I am testing different Sentiment Analysis techniques discovered in recent literature and providing clear results of how much different technique is improving baseline methodology performance. By doing that, my next step is to define a combined methodology for machine-learning based analysis and apply this combined approach to track the public sentiment regarding “Brexit” in real-time.
Technologies and tools used: Twitter API, Python, Scikit-learn, NLTK.
